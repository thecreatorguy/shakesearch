# Tim Johnson's ShakeSearch
Hi, I'm Tim Johnson, a college student at RIT with 2 semesters remaining,
Spring 2021 and Fall 2021. With only a year left until my education is
complete, I think it's just about early enough to start looking into long
term careers. Not only does this job appeal to me because the company looks
like it's a great place to work, and the main technologies at play are
exactly those that I want to be involved with, but this "screening" 
process of a project allows me to flex/put into practice my current 
skills (Go) and also learn more about the technologies I want to become
more involved with (React). Pulley, if this ever sees your eyes, thank
you for this opportunity!

## Plan
This readme will be a full document of my thought processes and planning-
none if it will be edited, only new entries will be added, so as to see
the process clearly as it evolves. While I do have confidence in my skills,
I believe it's best to keep an open mind and to keep looking for more things
to improve upon.

### Entry 1- 1:35AM December 17th, 2020
The first things on my mind for improvements are the things mentioned in
previous readme: the case sensitivity of the search (which proved immediately
annoying when I tried to search "hamlet" instead of "Hamlet"), and the need
for a complete match for searching. Later, though- it's getting late!
